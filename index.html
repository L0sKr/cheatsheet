        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The vertical margins of two elements 
            which are next to eachother will collapse unlike the horizontal margins 
            which will add up.</p>
        <p>The interpretation of the box model can be altered when specifying that the 
            width and height correspond to the distance between the borders horizontally 
            and vertically respectively.</p>
        <p>To do so, one has to add the specification : <span class="code">box-sizing : border-box;</span>.</p>

        <h2>Clear</h2>
        <p>The clear CSS property sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared) 
            floating elements that precede it. The clear property applies to floating and 
            non-floating elements.</p>
